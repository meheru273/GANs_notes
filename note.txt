Open source models: 
    These models are free to download and manipulate and runs locally
    for example Facebook's,s LLAMA is open source
Prompts:
    prompts are instructions given to the model to guide the output
Structured output generation:
    some LLMs can create structured data .Structured data can be stored in database.
    1. type dictionary - python dictionary with keys and values
    2. pydantic 
    3. json schema  
Output parsers: 
    helps generate structured data from all kind of models
    four types
Runnables:
    helps create chains .just like object oriented programming's abstract classes 
    it chains different classes using inheritance 
    1. task specific Runnables
    2. primitive runnables 
        1. RunnableSequential 
        2. RunnableParallel 
        3. RunnablePassthorugh
        4. RunnableLambda
RAG:
    1. document loaders
    2. text splitters
    3. Vector databases
    4. Retrivers
text splitters:
    1. lenght based
    2. text structure based
    3. document structure based
    4. semantic meaning based
Three problems with LLMs:
    1.unable to read private data 
    2.unable to reach recent data after training
    3. halucination
IN-context learning: 
    when a model learns to solve a task by reading prompts
emergent-property:
    a behaviour that suddenly appears when it reaches certain scale
    or complexity even though it was not explicitly expected
RAG:
    is a way to make a LLM model smarter by giving it
    extra information at the time of asking
    1. indexing 
    2. retrieval 
    3. Augmentation
    4. generation
